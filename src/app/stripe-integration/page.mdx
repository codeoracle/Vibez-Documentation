# Stripe Integration

## Complete payment processing with subscriptions, webhooks, customer management, and billing

Appmint Vibe Studio makes payment debemos simple with Stripe. Describe your payment requirements and get a complete integration with webhooks and secure payment handling. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How it works

- Describe your payment needs in a prompt {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Appmint Vibe Studio generates the integration with Stripeâ€™s APIs {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Add your API keys to secrets when prompted {{ className: 'lead' }}
- LLM results vary, but we consistently get working Stripe integrations in one shot, including webhook verification. {{ className: 'lead' }}


## Example prompt

```

- Add Stripe payments for subscription billing with three tiers,
- one-time product purchases, and automatic invoice generation with
- webhook handling for failed payments and cancellations

```
