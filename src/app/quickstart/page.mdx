# Quickstart

### Create a full-stack application with backend APIs, database, and cloud deployment in under 3 minutes. {{ className: 'lead' }}


[Build a production app in 3 minutes](#) {{ className: 'lead' }}

This quickstart takes you from zero to a deployed, production-ready application in under 3 minutes. 
You’ll build a movie recommendation API with real backend services, database integration, and live deployment. {{ className: 'lead' }}

**Why a movie API?** It showcases real backend logic, database operations, external API integrations, and multiple service endpoints - everything you need for production applications. {{ className: 'lead' }}

**Built on Appmint Vibe Studio:** Appmint Vibe Studio generates apps using Appmint Vibe Studio’s framework for type-safe distributed systems. Unlike other AI tools that just generate code snippets, 
you get complete systems with APIs, databases, and infrastructure that actually work together. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What you’ll build

[By the end of this guide, you’ll have:](#) {{ className: 'lead' }}

- Backend API service with multiple endpoints {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Database integration for storing movie data {{ className: 'lead' }}
- External API integration with TMDB (The Movie Database) {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Live architecture diagrams showing your system {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Deployed application running on your cloud {{ className: 'lead' }}
- GitHub repository with full source code {{ className: 'lead' }}



## Generate your app
[Describe what you want to build](#)

In the chat interface, describe your system: {{ className: 'lead' }}

```bash {{ title: 'Build a movie recommendation API service that:' }}
- Gets popular movies from TMDB API
- Stores user favorites in a database
- Provides search functionality
- Has endpoints for getting movie details
- Includes user rating system
```


# Watch Appmint Vibe Studio create your system

Appmint Vibe Studio generates your complete application in 30-60 seconds, including: {{ className: 'lead' }}

- Backend services with type-safe APIs {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Database schema for users and favorites {{ className: 'lead' }}
- TMDB integration for movie data {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Authentication endpoints {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Rating and recommendation logic {{ className: 'lead' }}

[Here’s what the generated code looks like:](#)
```bash {{ title: '// movies/appmint.service.ts' }}
import { api } from "appmint.vibe.studio/api";
import { SQLDatabase } from "appmint.vibe.studio/storage/sqldb";

const db = new SQLDatabase("movies", {
  migrations: "./migrations",
});

export const search = api(
  { method: "GET", path: "/movies/search" },
  async ({ query }: { query: string }) => {
    // Your movie search logic here
    return await searchMovies(query);
  }
);
```

How it works: Each appmint.service.ts file defines your APIs and Appmint Vibe Studio automatically handles the HTTP endpoints,
 database connections, and service communication. {{ className: 'lead' }}
