# PostHog Integration

## Comprehensive analytics with event tracking, feature flags, conversion funnels, and user insights

Appmint Vibe Studio makes it easy to add comprehensive analytics using PostHog. Just describe your tracking needs,
 and Appmint Vibe Studio generates the integration with event tracking, feature flags, and user analytics. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How it works

- Describe your analytics needs in a prompt {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Appmint Vibe Studio generates the integration with PostHog’s API {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Add your project API key to secrets when prompted {{ className: 'lead' }}
- LLM results vary, but we’ve had success getting PostHog integrations working in one shot with proper event tracking. {{ className: 'lead' }}
 

## Example prompt

```
- Add PostHog analytics to track user signups,
- feature usage, and conversion funnels with A/B testing for new features
- and session recording for debugging user issues

```
