# Resend Integration

## Modern email delivery with transactional emails, templates, and delivery optimization

Appmint Vibe Studio makes it easy to add email functionality using Resend. Just describe what you want, 
and Appmint Vibe Studio generates the integration with proper error handling and best practices. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How it works

- Describe your email needs in a prompt {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Appmint Vibe Studio generates the integration with Resend’s API {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Add your API key to secrets when prompted {{ className: 'lead' }}
- LLM results vary, but we’ve had success getting Resend integrations working in one or two shots. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Example prompt

```
- Add email sending using Resend for welcome emails when users sign up,
- password reset links with secure tokens,
- and order confirmations with PDF receipts attached
```
